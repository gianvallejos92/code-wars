# A Needle in the Haystack
[Link: A Needle in the Haystack - CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56676e8fabd2d1ff3000000c/train/python)

Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

## Input
``` batch
["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"]
```

## Output
``` batch
"found the needle at position 5"
```
